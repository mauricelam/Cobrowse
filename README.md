Cobrowse
========

Synchronized browsing on chrome through websockets. Cobrowse is a chrome extension that synchronizes the browser actions between two or more computers. First start the node.js server component and then connect through the Chrome extension by clicking on the co-browse icon. 

This is a hackathon project and is not production ready. Currently I don't have plans to turn it into a nice (or even usable) package. Use at your own risk.
